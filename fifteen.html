  The base webpage for Zane's "Fifteen" puzzle. 
  Intially, the pre-set image is displayed in the puzzle area,
  and the pieces aren't shuffled. If the user clicks "shuffle",
  the pieces will be randomly moved, scrambling the image. When
  the cursor is above a movable piece, it turns red, and clicking
  it will cause it to swap posistion with the empty space. The user
  can also play music, change the puzzle pic, and change the 
  background image. 
  The goal is to restore the image's intial arrangement.-->

				The goal of the fifteen puzzle is to un-jumble its fifteen squares
				by repeatedly making moves that slide squares into the empty space.
				How quickly can you solve it?

				American puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely
				credited with creating the puzzle; indeed, Loyd claimed from 1891
				until his death in 1911 that he invented it.
				The puzzle was actually created around 1874 by Noyes Palmer Chapman,
				a postmaster in Canastota, New York.
